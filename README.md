# Nano_Flux
I am absolutely horrible with github, sorry if there is something wrong with this repository. But anyways<br> this this is a hackpad i've worked on for like a week?<br>

<b>FEATURES :</b>

*✩ ‎ ‎ Shortcut Modes (switch between)*<br>
*✩ ‎ ‎ 4 macros*<br>
*✩ ‎ ‎ OLED screen displaying mode and<br> ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎‎ ‎ ‎  volume adjustments*<br>
*✩ ‎ ‎ A button to change mode*<br>
*✩ ‎ ‎ star cutout for the PCB to show through*<br>
*✩ ‎ ‎ Rotary encoder (adjusts volume and mutes when pressed)*<br>

## EXTRA NOTES :
Apart from coding the firmware i'm an entire newbie to CAD, so this was
<br> 
definetely a learning experience. And I definetely picked up a lot while
<br> 
working on this, but that is the entire reason I began working on my hackpad.
<br>
Since I haven't had too much making my own hardware, just wiritng firmware.
<br>
But anyways, The main idea and goal for my hack-pad was to keep it as compact
<br>
and small as possible, while still remaining as functional and useful as possible,
<br>
which is why I added modes, while only having 4 keys (for shortcuts) with the 3
<br>
modes, and counting, you can have over 16 shortcuts all in one tiny macro pad.
<br>
the modes work best when they are for specific tasks, as they keep all the
<br>
specific shortcuts you need in one space. for example, I have one for coding,
<br>
writing notes at school and one for researching. But of course more modes can always
<br>
be added.
